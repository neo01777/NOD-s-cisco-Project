### Cost Efficiency

The network still balances performance and affordability:
- **Cisco 2960 switches** provide reliable connectivity, while reducing the total quantity saves $1,000.
- A **Cisco 3650 switch** was added to improve network capabilities for high-traffic or core areas, supporting greater scalability and advanced features.

### Scalability

The introduction of the **Cisco 3650** allows for higher performance and increased network flexibility, providing better support for future expansions. The rest of the design, including VLANs and server expandability, remains scalable for growth while maintaining control over costs.

By adjusting the switch configuration, the network retains cost efficiency with enhanced scalability for future demands.
