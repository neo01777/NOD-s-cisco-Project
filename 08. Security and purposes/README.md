## Cross-Departmental Redundancy Plan

To improve network resilience and ensure the availability of services across departments, organizations implement a cross-departmental redundancy plan. This approach includes the following key elements:

- **Strategic Host Placement**: One or more hosts from each department are placed within the network segments of other departments.
  
- **Network Failure Mitigation**: In the event of a network failure affecting one department, critical services and connectivity can still be maintained through these strategically located hosts.

This redundancy plan significantly enhances the overall reliability of the network and facilitates uninterrupted operations. The inter-departmental hosts are capable of temporarily taking over necessary functions, ensuring that departmental services remain available.

Overall, this proactive measure aims to reduce downtime and maintain seamless service across the organization.

## RADIUS Authentication

RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) is employed to integrate network access control with a centralized authentication mechanism. Key benefits of this setup include:

- **Centralized User Management**: RADIUS allows for the secure management of user access to devices and services through a single authentication source.

- **Principles of AAA**: By configuring RADIUS in simulations, users can explore the principles of Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA). 

- **Enhanced Network Security**: Centralized authentication ensures that only authorized users can access network resources, thereby improving security.

This practical experience with RADIUS authentication is invaluable for understanding the complexities of managing secure access in real-world networks, equipping users with the skills needed to implement effective security measures.
