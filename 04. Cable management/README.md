## Cable Management

Our network security is designed to be both streamlined and effective. We utilize a single cable to connect our router to the network, ensuring clarity in our setup. Specific ports are designated for different areas:

- **G0/0**: For external WAN access
- **G0/1**: For internal LAN use
- **G0/2**: For server connections

This configuration simplifies security management by clearly separating network segments, which facilitates easier monitoring and protection of our data and resources.

## VLANs

Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) are utilized to simulate the segmentation of networks into isolated subnetworks within the same physical infrastructure. This approach provides several advantages:

- **Enhanced Network Efficiency**: VLANs allow for better management of network resources by logically separating devices.
- **Improved Security**: By isolating sensitive data traffic from general network traffic, VLANs enhance overall network security.
- **Manageability**: VLANs simplify network management by allowing administrators to segment traffic and enforce security policies.

Through VLAN configuration exercises, users can observe firsthand how traffic is managed and isolated, how broadcast domains are limited to improve performance, and how VLANs support the implementation of security policies.

This simulation experience is crucial for mastering network design and management principles in complex environments.

## Access Lists

Access Lists (ACLs) enable users to define rules that permit or deny traffic based on various criteria, such as IP addresses, protocols, and ports. They serve as a practical method for:

- **Implementing Network Security Measures**: ACLs help enforce security protocols within the network.
- **Controlling Traffic Flow**: They regulate the movement of data through the network, ensuring compliance with established policies.
- **Enforcing Policy Compliance**: ACLs support the enforcement of organizational security policies.

By integrating access lists into network simulations, learners can explore the impact of various security configurations on network performance and security, gaining valuable insights into effective network management practices.
